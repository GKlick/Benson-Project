In considering the stakeholder’s goal of improving outreach to New Yorkers interested in supporting diversity in tech, we propose to combine Data Science techniques with an understanding of the foundation’s core constituency.

To achieve this outcome we will examine popular subway stations for the following characteristics:
    - Direct access to the Gala location
    - Tech industry density
    - Nearby affluent neighborhoods

Our approach considers the Gala date at the start of the summer, examining MTA data from May, June, and July for the past two years, identifying stations with the highest exit rates. We then prioritize stations with the characteristics listed above. This ensures exposure to individuals most interested in attending and contributing to the cause.
